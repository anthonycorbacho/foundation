This starter kit is a starting point for building production grade scalable Go service applications.
The goal of this Foundation is to provide a proven starting point for new projects that reduce the repetitive tasks in getting a new project launched to production.

This project should not be considered a "framework".
Coding is a discovery process and with that, this project leaves you in control of your projectâ€™s architecture and development.
